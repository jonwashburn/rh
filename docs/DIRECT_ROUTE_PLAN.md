# Plan: Reworking the Lean Proof to Use the Direct Route

## Executive Summary

Yes, we can rework the Lean proof to avoid H¹-BMO duality by following the direct approach from the written proof (Riemann-lean-verified.tex). This approach uses specific properties of even windows and direct energy estimates.

## The Key Insight

The written proof (lines 1505-1523 and 2420-2440) shows that we don't need the full H¹-BMO duality theorem. Instead, we can use:

1. **Even windows annihilate affine functions**: For our specific window ψ (even, compact support), the Hilbert transform derivative `(H[φ_I])'` annihilates affine functions
2. **Direct Cauchy-Schwarz**: Apply Cauchy-Schwarz directly with scale-invariant bounds
3. **Uniform smallness**: Prove that on each Whitney interval, a certain ratio stays below 1/2

## What We Already Have

### ✅ Available Components
- CR-Green pairing machinery (`CRGreenOuter.lean`)
- Poisson plateau bounds with explicit constant (`PoissonPlateau.lean`)
- The correct function signature in `localWedge_from_pairing_and_uniformTest`
- Whitney box infrastructure

### ❌ What's Missing
- Direct proof that even windows annihilate affine functions
- Explicit Cauchy-Schwarz application for our specific setup
- The actual implementation to replace the `sorry`

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Add Helper Lemmas
```lean
-- In DirectBridge.lean or similar
lemma even_window_annihilates_affine (ψ : ℝ → ℝ) (hψ_even : Function.Even ψ) :
  ∀ a b, ∫ t, (a * t + b) * (deriv (HilbertTransform ψ)) t = 0
```

### Step 2: Direct Energy Bound
Following lines 1505-1523 of the written proof:
```lean
theorem direct_CR_Green_bound (U : harmonic) (ψ : even_window) :
  |∫ ψ · ∂_σ U| ≤ C(ψ) * sqrt(∬ |∇U|² σ)
```

### Step 3: Replace the Sorry
In `BoundaryWedge.lean`, replace the `sorry` at line 102 with:
```lean
-- Apply the direct approach from the written proof
-- 1. Use even window property to subtract affine calibrant
-- 2. Apply Cauchy-Schwarz with scale-invariant bounds  
-- 3. Combine with plateau lower bound
-- The ratio C(ψ)*sqrt(Kξ)/(π*c0) < 1/2 gives the wedge
```

## Why This Works

### From the Written Proof (Key Citations):

**Lemma 3.23 (lines 1505-1523)**: Shows uniform bound WITHOUT H¹-BMO:
> "In distributions, ⟨H[u'],φ_I⟩=⟨u,(H[φ_I])'⟩. Since ψ is even, (H[φ_I])' annihilates affine functions; subtract the calibrant ℓ_I and write v:=u-ℓ_I."

**Theorem 2.13 (lines 2420-2440)**: Direct path to (P+):
> "By the all-interval Carleson bound... Consequently, by Lemma 3.24 and the schedule clip, the quantitative phase cone holds on all Whitney intervals"

**The Bypass**: Instead of proving the full H¹-BMO duality theorem, we:
- Use the specific structure of our problem (even windows)
- Apply direct energy estimates
- Get exactly the bound we need for the wedge

## Feasibility Assessment

### ✅ **FEASIBLE** because:
1. All mathematical components exist in the written proof
2. The Lean infrastructure is already in place
3. No deep new mathematics required - just implementation
4. The direct approach is actually simpler than H¹-BMO

### Effort Estimate:
- **Low-Medium**: 2-3 days for a Lean expert
- Main work: Translating the written proof's calculations into Lean
- No new theory development needed

## Next Steps

1. Create `DirectBridge.lean` with the helper lemmas
2. Implement the direct Cauchy-Schwarz bound
3. Update `BoundaryWedge.lean` to use the direct approach
4. Test compilation and verify no new axioms introduced

## Conclusion

The written proof provides a complete roadmap for avoiding H¹-BMO duality. We can implement this direct approach in Lean with moderate effort, resolving the last remaining `sorry` in the boundary wedge component.
