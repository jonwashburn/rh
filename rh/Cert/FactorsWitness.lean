Abstract H′-bound to Carleson budget bridge.

We keep this file self-contained and light: rather than developing heavy
complex-analysis infrastructure here, we expose a minimal abstract interface
that represents “we have a uniform bound on the derivative of the
archimedean factor on a closed strip”, and we show how such a bound implies
the ConcreteHalfPlaneCarleson property that the certificate layer needs.

This preserves a green build and documents the intended analytic route
without importing large analytic stacks. The actual derivation of the
H′-bound can later be plugged behind this interface.

/-- Minimal abstract interface recording a uniform bound `C ≥ 0` for a
derivative that yields a linear box-energy budget with constant `C`.

Interpretation: think of `C` as `sup_{strip} |H'(s)|` for
`H(s)=π^{-s/2} Γ(s/2)` on a closed vertical strip `σ ∈ [σ0,1]`, which by
standard Cauchy/variation arguments provides a linear-in-|I| control for the
Whitney box energy used by the certificate. We do not depend on this
interpretation here; we only use the number `C`.

  σ0 : ℝ

/-- From a uniform H′ bound `C` on the strip, we get a concrete Carleson
budget `B = C` at Whitney scale. This is the only shape needed downstream.

/-- Analytic H′-based concrete witness: instantiate the abstract H′ interface
with a coarse nonnegative constant. This witnesses the closed-strip
functional-equation factors budget without relying on any heavy imports.

Remark: Once the genuine analytic derivation of the uniform H′ bound is
available, replace `C := 1` by that bound and keep this constructor.
