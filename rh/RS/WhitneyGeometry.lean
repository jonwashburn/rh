# Minimal Whitney geometry scaffolding (structure-only)

This module provides lightweight definitions and simple helpers used by
`rh/rh/RS/BoundaryWedge.lean` for tents, shadows, fixed geometry flags,
and a bounded-overlap constant. It is intentionally permissive: the
definitions are minimal and the lemmas are simple wrappers suitable for
the algebraic endgame wiring. Replace with analytic geometry when ready.
