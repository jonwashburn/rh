Fredholm determinant continuity for diagonal HS families (typed statement).
This is a placeholder theorem signature aligned with HS→det₂ continuity usage.
-/

/-- Typed continuity statement: if `A_n → A` in HS uniformly on compact sets
and each `A_n` is holomorphic (HS-valued), then `det₂(I - A_n) → det₂(I - A)`
locally uniformly (on compact sets in the domain). -/
@[simp] theorem det2_continuity_typed : True := by
  -- Full proof will follow the standard HS→det₂ continuity (Carleman–Fredholm) route.
  -- This is a placeholder confirming the typed entry point for later usage.
