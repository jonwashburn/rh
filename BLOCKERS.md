RS: ZetaNoZerosOnRe1FromSchur requires a ζ→Θ/N analytic bridge (Θ Schur on Ω, N analytic nonvanishing on closure); missing in codebase/mathlib, so export is blocked.
RS-ASSIGN: Producing `assign : Re=1 → LocalPinchData` from ζ→Θ/N needs a local removable-extension lemma ensuring an analytic `g` with `g(ρ)=1` agreeing with `Θ` on punctured neighborhoods; not present in mathlib at this specificity.
RS: Explicit Θ,N via Cayley with F:=2J and J:=det₂/(outer·ξ), ζ = Θ/N off zeros, and the pinned limit at ξ-zeros require a formal det₂/outer/ξ interface; not available—provide statement-level interface only.
- MATH-BLOCKER: Boundary assignment via pinned removable set
  - Location: `rh/RS/SchurGlobalization.lean`
  - Lean goal / statement: For each z with z.re = 1, choose open U ⊆ Ω and Z := Z(ξ), pick ρ ∈ Z ∩ U, and construct analytic g on U with EqOn Θ g (U \ Z) and g(ρ)=1, using Tendsto Θ → 1 along Ω \ Z near ρ (pinned limit). Package as `LocalPinchDataZ`.
  - Proposed approach: Need a mathlib lemma: from Θ analytic on Ω \ Z and Schur on Ω, plus lim Θ = 1 along Ω \ Z at ρ, build a removable analytic extension g on a small disc U with g(ρ)=1 and EqOn off Z. This is a multi-point removable-singularity construction relying on Riemann's theorem and boundary pinning; encode or cite if exists; otherwise keep as blocker.
  - Current RS interface provided for handoff: `OffZerosBoundaryHypothesis (Θ N)` requiring
    `IsSchurOn Θ Ω` and `(∀ z, z.re = 1 → ∃ (U Z) (data : LocalPinchDataZOff Θ N U Z), z ∈ U \ Z)`, and
    the RS corollary `ZetaNoZerosOnRe1_from_offZerosAssignmentStatement` which concludes
    `∀ z, z.re = 1 → riemannZeta z ≠ 0`. A longer-reasoning agent should produce the local
    data (U, Z = Z(ξ), ρ, g, agreement, g(ρ)=1, ζ=Θ/N, N≠0 on U \ Z) for each boundary point.
 - H′‑Cauchy (GammaBounds): Need a mathlib-level Cauchy derivative bound usable as `Complex.norm_deriv_le_of_bound_on_sphere` (or equivalent) plus explicit Γ vertical‑strip bounds to formalize the uniform `‖H′‖` proof; providing Prop‑only existence and wiring meanwhile.

- MATH-BLOCKER: Uniform vertical-strip bound for H′(s)=π^{-s/2}Γ(s/2)
  - Location: `rh/academic_framework/GammaBounds.lean`
  - Lean goal / statement: Provide a proof of `exists_uniform_bound_H_deriv_on_strip σ0` (σ0∈(1/2,1]) — existence of C,m ≥ 0 with `‖(π^{-s/2}Γ(s/2))'‖ ≤ C·(1+|Im s|)^m` for σ∈[σ0,1].
  - Proposed approach: Combine vertical-strip Stirling bounds for Γ and Γ′ with `|π^{-s/2}| = π^{-Re(s)/2}`; encode in mathlib if available, else externalize and keep interface.
  - Stub: `RH.AcademicFramework.GammaBounds.exists_uniform_bound_H_deriv_on_strip`

- MATH-BLOCKER: Carleson box energy framework on half-plane (Whitney boxes)
  - Location: meta-proof/rh/Cert/KxiPPlus.lean (interface needed)
  - Lean goal / statement: Define and use a Carleson measure `μ = |∇U|^2 σ dt dσ` and prove `μ(Q(I)) ≤ C · |I|` for analytic `U = Re log ξ` on Whitney boxes.
  - Proposed approach: Seek or build an interface around Poisson extensions and Carleson embedding on the half-plane; if missing, isolate as axioms in a separate namespace and keep proofs external.
  - Stub: `Cert.CarlesonBoxEnergyWhitney`
  - Progress: Added `WhitneyInterval`, `CarlesonBox`, and `BoxEnergy` interfaces (no axioms) in `rh/Cert/KxiPPlus.lean`. Introduced `KxiBound` and `PPlusFromCarleson` statement forms.
  - Next: Added `CRGreenPairing` and `PPlusFromCRGreenAndKxi` statement forms to capture the CR–Green implication to `(P+)` under a box-energy budget.
  - Progress (cont.): Added bridging Props `WindowedPhaseFromCRGreen` and `WhitneyWedgeFromCRGreen`, plus end-to-end `PPlusFromCRGreenVK` capturing the CR–Green + L2 annuli + VK counts chain.
  - Progress (cont.2): Added `CarlesonEnergyBudget` and `CarlesonToCRGreen` interfaces to explicitly encode “box-energy budget ⇒ CR–Green test control”. Refined `UnimodularBoundary`, `AnalyticOnΩ`, and introduced `bracket` used in VK counts. All additions remain statement-level; no axioms introduced.
  - Next steps: (i) Decide representation of the boundary test `TestIntegral` against `H^1` atoms/Poisson kernels and connect to `Cψ^{(H^1)}`; (ii) Provide a concrete Carleson measure instantiation for `BoxEnergy` on the half-plane; (iii) Align `AnnularL2KernelBound` with the precise geometry of `CarlesonBox`.

- MATH-BLOCKER: VK zero-density/counting usable form
  - Location: meta-proof/rh/Cert/KxiPPlus.lean (Kξ bound interface)
  - Lean goal / statement: A lemma giving annular counts `ν_k ≲ 2^k L log ⟨T⟩ + log ⟨T⟩` sufficient to derive `Kξ` Carleson bound.
  - Proposed approach: Cite Titchmarsh/Ivić statements; provide constants abstractly, keeping formalization as assumptions until mathlib support exists.
  - Stub: `Cert.VKAnnularCount`
  - Progress: Added `VKAnnularCount` with explicit `nu` and inequality using `bracket T`, plus `AnnularL2KernelBound`, `AnnularL2ToKxi`, and `KxiFromVK` reduction Prop.
  - Next: Provide an instantiation plan for `nu` from a specific VK density bound in the text and sketch the sum-over-annuli derivation as a separate lemma file.

- MATH-BLOCKER: Characterize zeros of ζ(s) with Re(s) ≤ 0 as trivial zeros
  - Location: rh/academic_framework/EulerProductMathlib.lean:125
  - Lean goal / statement:
    `∀ z : ℂ, z.re ≤ 0 → riemannZeta z = 0 → ∃ n : ℕ, 0 < n ∧ z = -2 * n`
  - Proposed approach: cite the functional equation and known classification of zeros; replace with a mathlib lemma if/when available. Until then, keep proof externalized.
  - Stub: `Blockers.zeta_zero_in_Re_le_zero_is_trivial`

- MATH-BLOCKER: Fill proof of `zeta_zero_in_Re_le_zero_is_trivial` (current stub)
  - Location: rh/Blockers/Triage.lean:12–16
  - Lean goal / statement:
    `∀ z : ℂ, z.re ≤ 0 → riemannZeta z = 0 → ∃ n : ℕ, 0 < n ∧ z = (-2 : ℂ) * (n : ℂ)`
  - Proposed approach:
    1) Use the functional equation `ξ(s) = ξ(1 - s)` with `ξ` entire, and symmetry of zero sets.
    2) Combine with known nontrivial-zero localization `0 < Re(s) < 1` to exclude Re(s) ≤ 0 except the gamma/polynomial trivial factors.
    3) Derive that any zero with Re ≤ 0 must come from the gamma/polynomial factor, hence at negative even integers.
    4) Alternatively, use Hadamard product factorization of ζ and the gamma factor’s poles/zeros alignment.
  - Dependencies needed in mathlib:
    - Functional equation in a usable form; zero-set symmetries.
    - Statement that nontrivial zeros lie in the critical strip.
  - Interim helpers added:
    - `zeta_trivial_zero` and `zeta_eq_zero_of_neg_even` wrappers using `riemannZeta_neg_two_mul_nat_add_one` to unblock downstream uses where only the forward direction is needed.

- RESOLVED: Non-vanishing of ζ on the boundary line Re(s) = 1
  - Location: `rh/RS/SchurGlobalization.lean`, `rh/academic_framework/EulerProductMathlib.lean`
  - Lean goal / statement:
    `∀ z : ℂ, z.re = 1 → riemannZeta z ≠ 0`
  - Resolution: Implemented `RS.ZetaNoZerosOnRe1FromSchur` by delegating to the mathlib lemma
    `riemannZeta_ne_zero_of_one_le_re`. Added public wrapper
    `RH.AcademicFramework.EPM.zeta_nonzero_re_eq_one` delegating to RS.
  - Stubs: none

- MATH-BLOCKER: Half‑plane Poisson transport: (P+) ⇒ interior nonnegativity for F := (2:ℂ)·J_pinch det2 O (prove `HasHalfPlanePoissonTransport`); requires half‑plane Hardy/Smirnov boundary theory not currently in mathlib.
 - MATH-BLOCKER: Half‑plane Poisson transport (Hardy/Smirnov): For analytic F on Ω = {Re>1/2}, need `HasHalfPlanePoissonRepresentation F` (Poisson representation of Re F with integrability) to derive `HasHalfPlanePoissonTransport`. This half‑plane Hardy theory is not in mathlib.

- MATH-BLOCKER: Disk Poisson/Herglotz representation (positivity)
  - Location: academic layer (AF) – used to instantiate `HasHalfPlanePoissonRepresentation` via Cayley
  - Lean goal / statement: For holomorphic F̃ on 𝔻 with a.e. boundary trace ũ := Re F̃|∂𝔻 ∈ L¹_loc (bounded in our application), prove `Re F̃(z) = ∫ ũ(ζ) P_𝔻(z,ζ) dθ`; in particular if ũ ≥ 0 a.e. then `Re F̃ ≥ 0` in 𝔻. Transport to Ω through the Cayley map to obtain the half‑plane representation/positivity.
  - Proposed approach: Use classical disk Poisson/Herglotz representation (Carathéodory/Herglotz) and conformal covariance of Poisson kernels under Möbius maps. Not currently available in mathlib.

- MATH-BLOCKER: Disk outer existence with prescribed boundary modulus
  - Location: academic layer (AF) – used to construct `O` on Ω with `|O| = |det₂/ξ|` on the boundary
  - Lean goal / statement: Given `g : ∂𝔻 → (0,∞)` with `log g ∈ L¹`, construct an outer function `Ō` on 𝔻 with `|Ō| = g` a.e. (via Poisson integral of `log g` and harmonic conjugate), then pull back to Ω by Cayley. Ensures outer cancellation in CR–Green.
  - Proposed approach: Standard Hardy–Smirnov outer construction on 𝔻 (Poisson extension + harmonic conjugate), then compose with Cayley to Ω. Not currently available in mathlib.

- MATH-BLOCKER: Numeric enclosure for arithmetic tail constant `K0`
  - Location: rh/academic_framework/EulerProduct/K0Bound.lean
  - Lean goal / statement:
    Prove the explicit bound `K0 ≤ 0.03486808` where
    `K0 = (1/4) * ∑_{k≥2} (∑_p p^{-k}) / k^2`.
  - Proposed approach:
    Split `k ≤ 20` via interval-checked prime sums and bound the tail by
    `∑_{k≥21} (ζ(k)-1)/k^2` using a proven inequality (Dusart/Rosser–Schoenfeld)
    and an integral remainder. Encapsulate numerics in a separate file or use
    mathlib numerics/interval tactics if available.
  - Stub: none (definitions landed; numeric evaluation pending)

- SUB-BLOCKER: Monotone subtype tsum comparison (primes to integers)
  - Location: rh/academic_framework/EulerProduct/K0Bound.lean
  - Lean goal / statement:
    For `k ≥ 2` and nonnegative terms, establish `∑_{p} p^{-k} ≤ ∑_{n≥2} n^{-k}`
    and lift to `K0 ≤ (1/4) ∑_{k≥2} (∑_{n≥2} n^{-k})/k^2`.
  - Proposed approach:
    Implement a helper: for nonnegative `f : ℕ → ℝ_{ }`,
    `∑'_{p:Nat.Primes} f p ≤ ∑'_{n:ℕ} f n`. Use an indicator reindexing or
    existing mathlib lemmas if available; otherwise, add a local lemma in the
    EulerProduct namespace.
  - Stub: local helper lemma `tsum_subtype_le_total` (nonnegative)

- MATH-BLOCKER: RvM short-interval zero-count bound (VK/annular counts) for ξ
  - Location: `rh/Cert/KxiWhitney_RvM.lean`
  - Lean goal / statement: Formalize `rvM_short_interval_bound` (|{ρ : Im ρ ∈ [T−L,T+L]}| ≤ A0 + A1·L·log⟨T⟩ for Whitney L ≍ c/log⟨T⟩, large T) and derive `kxi_whitney_carleson_of_rvm : KxiBound α c` via annular Poisson L^2 summation.
  - Proposed approach: Needs mathlib-level zero-counting/density for ζ/ξ on short intervals (Riemann–von Mangoldt/Vinogradov–Korobov) and a half-plane Carleson box framework; add once available, then implement the neutralization + annular aggregation.

- MATH-BLOCKER: Surrogate VK→annulus counts (ZeroCountAPI → ν_k bound)
  - Location: `rh/Cert/KxiWhitney_RvM.lean`
  - Lean goal / statement: Given `ZeroCountAPI` with `N : ℝ → ℝ → ℝ` monotone in T and a VK-density predicate for `N`, prove
    `∃ a1 a2 ≥ 0, ∀ k, ν_k ≤ a1·2^k·L·log⟨T⟩ + a2·2^{-k}·log⟨T⟩`, with `ν_k := N(T,2^{k+1}L) − N(T,2^k L)` and `L=c/log⟨T⟩`.
  - Proposed approach: Monotone telescope over `R ∈ [2^k L, 2^{k+1} L]`, averaging the VK bound to gain the extra `2^{-k}` on the constant term; requires a small lemma formalizing the average bound for monotone functions.

- MATH-BLOCKER: Carleson box computation for prime-power tail `U₀`
  - Location: rh/academic_framework/EulerProduct/K0Bound.lean (conceptual origin)
  - Lean goal / statement:
    Derive rigorously that the Carleson box ratio of `U₀(s) = Re ∑_{p}∑_{k≥2} p^{-ks}/k`
    over Whitney boxes equals `(1/4) * ∑_{p}
    ∑_{k≥2} p^{-k}/k^2`, i.e., the constant `K0` defined here.
  - Proposed approach:
    Formalize the half-plane Carleson geometry for harmonic functions and the
    identity `|∇ Re f|^2 = |f'|^2` for analytic `f`, then compute the Whitney
    box integral explicitly and pass sup over normalized boxes.
  - Stub: none (requires a small Carleson framework; keep externalized until available)

- MATH-BLOCKER: Poisson approximate identity (a.e.) for normalized half‑plane kernel on ℝ
  - Location: `rh/RS/PPlusFromCarleson.lean` (kernel facts section)
  - Lean goal / statement:
    `lemma poisson_approximate_identity_ae {f : ℝ → ℝ} (hf : LocIntegrable f Measure.lebesgue) :
      ∀ᵐ x, Filter.Tendsto (fun b : ℝ => ∫ t, RH.RS.poissonKernel b (x - t) * f t ∂Measure.lebesgue)
        (Filter.nhdsWithin 0 (Set.Ioi 0)) (Filter.nhds (f x))`
  - Proposed approach: Use mathlib's approximate identity or convolution framework on ℝ with the normalized Poisson family `(1/π) * b / (x^2 + b^2)`. If not available, this needs a new development: standard harmonic analysis a.e. boundary convergence for Poisson smoothing.
  - Stub: none yet

- MATH-BLOCKER: Poisson square off-support on Whitney boxes (analytic integral)
  - Location: `rh/RS/CRGreenOuter.lean`
  - Lean goal / statement:
    For `I=[T−L,T+L]`, `0<σ≤αL`, and `|x−T|≥2^{k−1}L`, prove
    `∫_{t∈I} (σ / ((t−x)^2 + σ^2))^2 dt ≤ |I| · σ^2 / (((2^{k−1}L)^2 + σ^2)^2)`,
    hence `∫_{0}^{αL} ∫_{t∈I} Kσ(t−x)^2 σ dt dσ ≤ |I| · (α^4/4) · 4^{-k}`.
  - Proposed approach: Use `∫_I f ≤ |I|·sup_I f`, monotonicity of `(d^2+σ^2)^{-2}` in `d`, and
    `∫_0^{αL} σ^3 dσ = (αL)^4/4`. Requires basic measure/integral lemmas on intervals.

Missing: interval sup bound ∫_I f ≤ |I|·sup_I f (finite interval, Lebesgue).

- MATH-BLOCKER: Centered balayage almost-orthogonality (row-sum control)
  - Location: `rh/RS/CRGreenOuter.lean`
  - Lean goal / statement:
    With `S(σ,t)=∑_{γ∈A_k}(Kσ(t−γ)−Kσ(t−T))`, show
    `∬_{Q(α,I)} S(σ,t)^2 σ ≤ (α^4/2) · |I| · 4^{-k} · (#A_k)`.
  - Proposed approach: Apply the off-support square bound termwise after centering (outer cancellation),
    then a Schur/Bessel-style row-sum estimate to keep dependence linear in `#A_k`.

- Missing: centered balayage row-sum (Schur/Bessel) to keep linear ν_k.

- MATH-BLOCKER: H¹–BMO windows theory for local Whitney wedge → a.e. boundary wedge (P+)
  - Location: `rh/RS/BoundaryWedge.lean` (line 102 - `localWedge_from_pairing_and_uniformTest`)
  - Lean goal / statement: From CR-Green pairing control and Poisson plateau witness, derive `RH.Cert.PPlus F` (i.e. `∀ᵐ t, 0 ≤ Re F(1/2+it)`).
  - Current status: Interface implemented with `sorry` marking where the analytical proof is needed
  - Required mathematical components:
    - H¹-BMO duality theorem (Fefferman-Stein)
    - Carleson measure characterization
    - Windowed phase functional bound from box energy
    - Measure-theoretic boundary trace/Poisson lemmas
  - Proposed approach: Use H¹–BMO windows criterion with CR–Green pairing bound and uniform Poisson test-energy to upgrade the local Whitney wedge to a.e. boundary nonnegativity.

- MATH-BLOCKER: Integral of odd integrable function over ℝ is 0 (to discharge `even_function_linear_vanishes`)
  - Location: `rh/RS/DirectBridge.lean`
  - Lean goal / statement: For integrable `f : ℝ → ℝ` with `Function.Odd f`, prove `∫ t, f t = 0`.

- MATH-BLOCKER: Direct CR–Green pairing bound assembly (Cauchy–Schwarz details)
  - Location: `rh/RS/DirectBridge.lean` (`direct_windowed_phase_bound`)
  - Lean goal / statement: Fill the technical Cauchy–Schwarz application to produce `|∫_I ψ·B| ≤ Cψ · √(Kξ·|I|)` from the stated hypotheses.

- MATH-BLOCKER: Scale–invariant Dirichlet bound for Poisson extensions (energy scales linearly with |I|)
  - Location: `rh/RS/DirectBridge.lean` (`poisson_extension_scale_invariant`)
  - Lean goal / statement: From compact support of `ψ`, prove `∬_Q |∇V|² σ ≤ C(ψ,α) · |I|` for the Poisson extension `V`.

- MATH-BLOCKER: Whitney CR–Green cutoff identity with scale‑invariant remainders
  - Location: `rh/RS/CRGreenOuter.lean`
  - Lean goal / statement:
    For harmonic `U` on the half‑plane with boundary conjugate `W`, a Whitney interval `I=[t0−L,t0+L]`, cutoff `χ` (χ≡1 on `Q(αI)`, supp χ⊆`Q(α′I)`, ‖∇χ‖∞≲1/L), and Poisson test `Vψ` (Poisson extension of an even mass‑1 window `ψL,t0`), prove
    `∬_{Q(α′I)} ∇U · ∇(χ Vψ) = ∫_I ψ (−W′) + R_side + R_top` and
    `|R_side| + |R_top| ≤ C(ψ,α′) · ( ∬_{Q(α′I)} |∇U|^2 σ )^{1/2}`
    with `C(ψ,α′)` independent of `t0,L` (scale‑invariant).
  - Proposed approach: Integration by parts/Green identity plus Cauchy–Schwarz; control side/top terms via the cutoff geometry and uniform test‑energy of `Vψ`.

- MATH-BLOCKER: Boundary CR trace on bottom edge (distributional justification)
  - Location: `rh/RS/CRGreenOuter.lean`
  - Lean goal / statement:
    On the bottom edge `{σ=0}` of a Whitney box, justify in distributions that `−∂σ U = ∂t W` and that the bottom-edge contribution in the Green identity equals the boundary term `∫_I ψ (−W′)` (with cutoff `χ≡1` on `Q(αI)`).
  - Proposed approach: Use a half‑plane Cauchy–Riemann boundary trace lemma for `log J = U + iW` and pass to the limit under the cutoff; if absent in mathlib, record as a blocker and keep the interface lemma parametric in a trace hypothesis.

- MATH-BLOCKER: CR–Green Whitney pairing for H¹ atoms from a half‑plane Carleson box budget (Whitney scale) — show: given `ConcreteHalfPlaneCarleson Kξ` for `U = Re log J`, any Whitney interval `I` and H¹‑atom `a` on `I` satisfy `|∫_I (Re F(1/2+it))·a(t) dt| ≤ C·Kξ·|I|` (uniform `C`), via a CR–Green identity with scale‑invariant remainders and Cauchy–Schwarz.
